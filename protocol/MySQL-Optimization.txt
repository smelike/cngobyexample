MySQL 优化


1、SQL 语句优化


查询过程中，所有的 constant tables 会比其他表先进行读取。

A constant table is any of the following:

- An empty table or a table with one row.

- A table that is used with a WHERE clause on a PRIMARY KEY or a UNIQUE index, where all index parts are compared to constant expressions and 
are defined as NOT NULL.
